# Reading Financial Statements - Terminology (Financials Series Part - 2)

## Revenues

- Revenue = All incoming money a.k.a <i>The Top Line</i>
  - Profit = Revenue - Expenses

- Operating Revenue = Money earned from actual sales in a business

## Profits

- Gross Profit = Operating Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)<sup>[1][2]</sup>
- Operating Profit = Gross profit - Operating Expenses - Depreciation and Amortization
- Net Profit (or Net Income a.k.a <i>The Bottom Line</i>) = Operating Profit - Interest payments - Taxes

[1] Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) <u>includes</u> machinery costs, direct labor costs, raw material costs
[2] Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) <u>does not include</u> money paid to sales department, advertising etc. That goes into Operating Expenses

## EBIT

Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) = operating profit + non-operating revenue<sup>[3]</sup>

[3] Non-operating revenue <u>includes</u> income from non-core business activities such as income from investing company's cash, income gained by selling a division etc.

## Take-aways

- Growth in EBIT doesn't tell the full story. Look at Growth in Operating Profit (or that in Operating Revenue) if not that in Net Profit a.k.a <i>The Bottom Line</i>
