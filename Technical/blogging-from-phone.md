# Blogging from phone

It isn't the lack of intent to write but it is the entire setup required to do the writing that hinders it.

With this blog being on GitHub, I can now write a Markdown file in my repository and commit to master branch for immediate publication/commit to a named branch for editing the 'Index' for this blog etc.
