# Setting up Matrix Server for Community Learning Project (Part 1)

## What?

Think of Slack. Think of Discord. This is a real-time communication forum enabling our continued learning.
The *difference*: we are in control of our data

## Why?

[Virtual](https://www.carnegielibrary.org/event/virtual-on-ramp-to-python-a-six-week-introduction-to-coding-2/) or otherwise, interested learners got together for 6 weeks to learn and practice Python programming language for more than 2 years. At the end of every offering, our participants asked: *What's next?*, *Is there a Level-2*?

We now launch this platform so our alumni and alumni-to-be can get together to enhance their learning. Learning is an ongoing journey and our goal is to extend the path we laid.

## Where?

Our server is hosted at <https://chat.fossterer.com>
To join the community and login later, proceed to [How do I](##how-do-i) guides

## Who?

We are the staff of Carnegie library of Pittsburgh and volunteering facilitators associated with program **On Ramp to Python: A Six Week Introduction to Coding**
