# Things to do when you are bored

Here are the things that fall under one or many of the below categories:

- things that I kept post-poning filling up my to-do list for weeks
- ideas as they come up and need a product backlog to be identified
- ideas that I can choose from once I conclude working on my priority for the current month

At any given time, the item with the longest description gets priority to be pulled out, a product backlog to be worked on and to be focussed on for the month

Another location to look in is my [cloud](https://cloud.fossterer.com/apps/deck#/)
