# The other side of VC Funding - Startups and Enterpreneurship Series (Part 1)

I was reading a related [eidel.io (2023-07-09) post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36654960) found on HackerNews about startups and immediately thought of â€˜Bootstrapped companiesâ€™.

Is there a community of such startup founders? That would be a good place to get more ideas.

I landed here - https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/future-of-the-bootstrapped-community-forum/7665.html - sadly a â€˜Goodbye postâ€™ but with useful suggestions/links at the end.

That further led me to find out a new term â€“ â€˜calm companiesâ€™! Of course Google search brings up a company with that name ðŸ˜Š but further in â€˜People also askâ€™ section, I found [this post](https://www.outseta.com/posts/calm#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCalm%20companies%20focus%20on%20profitability,grind%20to%20total%20market%20domination.%E2%80%9D)
