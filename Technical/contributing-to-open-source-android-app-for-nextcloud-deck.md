# Contributing to Open-Source Android App for Nextcloud Deck

As I am excited to have setup Strict SSL (HTTPS with HSTS) and minimal domain name cloud.fossterer.com using Nextcloud instance, the immediate requirement is to find a notes/reminder app as a replacement for Google Keep.

I'm excited to learn that the project [stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-deck](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-deck/) is active and is 100% Java. I'm cloning it to import into my Android Studio.

## ToDo:

1. Get build running and deploy onto my Oneplus 7 Pro
2. Integrate existing [REST API](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-deck/#-planned-features) using these [docs](https://github.com/nextcloud/deck#documentation)
3. Document methods used in the Activity file you are looking at
