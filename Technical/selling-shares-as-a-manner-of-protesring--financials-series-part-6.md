# Selling shares as a manner of protesting (Financials Series Part - 6)

(Keywords: ESG)

Divesting or selling away your equity(shares) in a company that is not acting in your interests is a way of expressing your opposition to their behavior at the time.

In extreme situations like as in the recent university protests against Israel-Hamas war (2024), the main call is exactly that - calling University endowment funds to get rid of any investments register to companies that are directly/indirectly enabling/benefiting from the war.

Universities maintain 'Endowment funds' as a vehicle to pool donations from various contributors that can arrive at anytime throughout the year. These are invested in the stock market and similar avenues so that they can be redeemed(withdrawn) when required to support new facility constructions, research projects etc.

CNN talked to Witold Henisz, vice dean and faculty director of the environmental, social and governance initiative at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

Quoted from the article -

    ..researchers posited that [lack of significant effect on companies targeted is] likely because “the boycott primarily reallocated shares and operations from ‘socially responsible’ [investors] to more indifferent investors and countries.”

    When you sell shares, said Henisz, you essentially give someone who cares less about the issue voice and you give up your own voice.

    Divesting may feel good, he said, “but it may have perverse outcomes.”

This is along the same idea that unless you hold a significant piece of a certain company (huge no. of shares), the seeking has barely any effect on the price in the stock market. Unexpected here is that statement about 'giving away your voice and transferring any power you might have had so far to those who don't care at all!'
