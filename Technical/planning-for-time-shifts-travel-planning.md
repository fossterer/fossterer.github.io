# Planning for Time Shifts (Travel Planning)

Writing this at 7:22 AM on Friday morning -

To be at the intended destination (less than 4hr 30 min. away) by 10:00 AM on Sunday morning, we have to start before or by 5:30 AM that day.

7:30 AM --> 5:30 AM is a 2 hr. shift.

Woke up today at 5:30 AM (6:10 AM to be precise) to be settled by 7:22 AM (7:10 AM to be precise)
Accordingly I should be awake by 4:10 AM (instead of 6:10 AM) if I intend to eat before starting

Accordingly, go to bed on Saturday night by 8:00 PM instead of 10:00 PM
To acclimate, go to bed on Friday night by 9:00 PM instead of 10:00 PM
