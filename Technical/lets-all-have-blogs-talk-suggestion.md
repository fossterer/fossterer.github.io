# Let's all have blogs! (Talk suggestion)

In this hands-on session, we'll go through the process of setting up a blog on our own. By the end of this session, every one of us would have a blog setup, be able to setup a pipeline/workflows to write posts per our own schedule. Participants can choose to host their blogs on Google Cloud, AWS EC2 or any VPS of their own choice (preferrably empty at the start).

1. We'll go through setting up Pelican, a Python-powered blogging tool, use any text editor of our choice to write blog posts, add images and upload content to publish onto the web using SSH. Next, we'll look at styling our blog with customized themes and adding plugins to make it unique.

2. Next, we'll explore the same workflow using Github Pages

I'll walk you through my own build pipeline and discuss how I turn my ideas into blogposts.

After the session, if participants are ready, let's group to individually go through the steps of purchasing a domain name. If you already have one, let's apply it right to your new blog then!

If you have always been suggested by friends that your amazing (but lengthy!) Facebook posts deserve to be in their own blog or you simply always wanted to have your own blog and just needed someone to unravel the steps right in front of you, this is the session you want to attend!
