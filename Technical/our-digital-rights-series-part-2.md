# Our Digital Rights Series: It has been two years since... (Part-2)

Hi,

Nearly [two years ago](https://blog.fossterer.com/Technical/my-story-of-quitting-whatsapp.html), I announced to you that I am quitting WhatsApp.
During this period I proposed a few ways to still be in touch with you, namely

- phone calls
- emails and
- SMS
and new alternatives.

I now want to listen to what you feel about my act.

Please think on the lines below and let me know your responses

- Over these two years, have you/your group wished there was a better way to communicate with me?
- Did you/your group feel I was missing something important you had to share?
- Were you (or your group) faced with an urgent situation where you needed an immediate response from me?
- Anything else I forgot?

Note: If you (or your group) agree with the points listed [here](https://blog.fossterer.com/Technical/my-story-of-quitting-whatsapp.html) yourself too and ever wishd there were a different way to get the benefits of WhatsApp/Facebook, please ask to find out what I have been doing.
You further help by sharing this with your other contacts that you think feel the same way about privacy and digital rights.

On a final note, I need your help in identifying any critical benefits missed due to not being in WhatsApp/Facebook.
Together we can make communication better for our friends and family.

Thanks
