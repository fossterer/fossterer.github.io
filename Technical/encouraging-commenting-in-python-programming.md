# Encouraging Comments in Programming

Hi Python learner,

The symbol # indicates the start of a comment.

You know, programs are not regular English with all their (, ; { and etc. symbols spread all over.

So even smart programmers after some time, forget the context that made them write the so-called code. It gets tougher for them to modify it without comments.

So during our sessions, both you and I would be using these "comments" a lot!
