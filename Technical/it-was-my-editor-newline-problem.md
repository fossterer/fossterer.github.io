# It was my editor/new line problem

The problem I described in the [post on last challenge](advent-of-code-2020-day-4-part-1.md) turned out to be line-ending issue after all.

As I described in [this discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k85av2/day_04_part_1_what_am_i_doing_wrong/), there indeed was no noew line at the end. So the final passport was never processed.
