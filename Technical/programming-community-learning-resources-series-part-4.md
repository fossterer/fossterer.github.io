# Programming Community Learning Resources (Part 4): Worldwide Slack channels

Hi,

To help our learners enter well-established and wider communities so they can enhance their learning, I have been exploring these 2 Slack communities focussed on Python:

- [PySlackers - An open community for Python programming enthusiasts](https://pyslackers.com/web) - This is a community that attracts global participation. Their [Code of Conduct/Community Guidelines](https://github.com/pyslackers/community/blob/master/introduction.md)
- [Code & Supply - Pitsburgh Slack](https://codeandsupply.co/chat) - A Pittsburgh local group; I attended more than 5 of their tech talks. Their [Code of Conduct/Community Guidelines](https://codeandsupply.co/policies/conduct)

I am wondering if it would be possible to suggest to learners in our welcome emails to look around these communitites.

Volunteering mentors and learners may choose to hang around there on their own schedules

What do you all think?
