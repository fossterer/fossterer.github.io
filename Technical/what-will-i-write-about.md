# What will I write about?

Now that I am free to type

whenever I feel like

with this platform to quickly write from

what will I write about?


Given that I am not writing

for Facebook, Professional blog etc.

what will I write about

since I am not trying to impress any followers


Do I really feel that free

to just speak out my mind

to not follow any order

that I usually aim for?


It's not just the order but

it is also the perceived social acceptance

of the things to write

that I don't need to conform to now


Yet I wonder

am I truly that free to write about

anything I feel like

or would I still censor myself?


What will I write about?
