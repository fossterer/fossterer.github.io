# What will I write about?

Now that I am free to type
whenever I feel like
with this platform to quickly write from
what will I write about?

Given that I am not writing
for Facebook, Professional blog etc.
what will I write about
since I am not trying to impress any followers

Do I really feel that free
to just speak out my mind
to not follow any order
that I usually aim for?

It's not just the order but
it is also the perceived sociall acceptance
of the things to write
