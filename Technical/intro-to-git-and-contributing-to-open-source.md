# Git? Github? How do I start contributing to open source projects? (Talk Suggestion)

If you've tried to get into contributing to FOSS projects but are stumbled by Git and other version control systems or use Git all day but want to get better at understanding your actions with it, come and learn. This is the discussion you wished someone had laid it out to you already.

For the sake of beginners of version control systems, we'll start with an introduction to ideas of VCS, why we need them and how to get integrate them into our open source contribution activities. The already initiated can benefit as we gradually transition into discussing a practical workflow that keeps everyone sane while working in software projects involving multiple engineers.

We'll go over pull request processes and merge conflict resolutions using Mozilla's open source projects as exmaple and a few projects on Github.

By the time you leave, you'll be able to appreciate the purpose of version control systems as well as learn best practices that help during development.

## Why am I the right person to deliver this talk?

While getting started with contributing to Mozilla and other open source projects in general 7 years ago, I educated myself with the usage of version control systems. Now as an experienced software engineer, I regularly use Gitflow workflow while working on multiple projects. This is the talk I wish I had when I when I was all on my own to learn and appreciate the role of version control systems - Mercurial and Git.
