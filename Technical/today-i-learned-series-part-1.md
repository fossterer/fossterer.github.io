# 3 Things for Sat Nov 25 2023 (Today I Learned Series Part-1)

1. Fractional Leadership is a setup where executives in senior roles can concurrently serve multiple organizations with their expertise.

But why a special term than contracting/freelancing?
Because these 'fractional roles' mean the person has more 'skin in the game' than a contractor. See https://www.divisional.co/blog/whats-fractional-employment-and-hows-it-different-from-freelancing#:~:text=Fractional%20employment%20is%20when%20an,the%20company%20compared%20to%20freelancing. - particularly the venn diagaram below it

2. I can write blog posts from GitHub Mobile app! Now that reduces friction in publishing my thoughts and things that I learn, such as this daily!

3. I'm going to embrace 'Actual Budget' for tracking my expenses!
https://actualbudget.com/open-source

- They have amazing docs explaining in just enough words the concepts seen in the app and their significance 

https://actualbudget.org/docs/budgeting/

Talk about great documentation for an open-source app!

- Actul has categories, rollovers and even templates for categories i.e. you can say every 6 months, automatically budget some $500 for auto insurance! And automatically use any remainder to cover other categories you defined!

All this comes with appropriate documentation too. Just keep pressing 'Next' in the documentation pages at the bottom for more concepts like 'Reconciling' etc.!

- Even when it was not open-source, Actual used a local-first approach despite being a web app!
"It's a local-first app using a fancy technology called CRDTs that syncs changes across devices."

Wow for an app that I have use for and is available offline despite involving a remote server! Of course I haven't used it pre-open-source but still!

**Question:** Does this mean, pre-open-source, if I used Actual's remote server setup, data used to be stored on that remote machine? Need to find out from community
